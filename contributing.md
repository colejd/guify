# Contributing

All work on this library is done against the `develop` branch, which gets merged into `main` when a new release is ready. Accordingly, if you'd like to contribute to Guify, please work off of the `develop` branch.

This isn't strictly necessary, but please make sure you're not introducing any new ESLint warnings. If you're on VS Code, you can install the ESLint plugin to make this easier, or you can run it from the command line with `npm run lint`.

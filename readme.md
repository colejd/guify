Guify provides you a simple GUI for your JS code. I made this because there wasn't anything really good for quick GUI creation for things like [three.js](https://threejs.org/) or [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) projects.

Guify gives you toast notifications, as well as an optional header bar to give your project a "web app" look. Each component of the GUI can be bound to a variable so you don't have to manually poll its state.

Guify is designed to be accessibility-friendly, but I don't have a good way to test it. If something doesn't work for you, please file an issue and I'll do my best to help!

[Check out the React version!](https://github.com/dbismut/react-guify)


## Installation
`npm install --save guify`, or copy `guify.js` from [`/lib`](/lib).


## Usage
For browser projects, you can use the transpiled version in [`/lib`](/lib).
If you're working with ES6 (for example, in a Node project), you can
use the files at [`/src`](/src) directly.

The API can be found at [/docs/api.md](/docs/api.md).


### Quick Start
First import using either `require` or ES6 imports:
```js
// ES6
import guify from 'guify'

// Require
let guify = require('guify');
```

Then you can make a quick GUI this way:
```js
var gui = new guify({
    title: "Some Title",
    align: 'right',
    theme: 'light'
});

gui.Register([
    {
        type: 'range', label: 'Range',
        min: 0, max: 20, step: 1
    },
    {
        type: 'button', label: 'Button'
    },
    {
        type: 'checkbox', label: 'Checkbox'
    }
]);
```

See [example.html](/example/index.html) for a more complete example.


### Building This Package
If you want to build this package, you can run `npm install` and then `npm run build`, which will create `/lib/guify.min.js`.

NPM commands:

- `build:prod`: Creates `/lib/guify.min.js`, the default script used by this package.
- `build:dev`: Creates `/lib/guify.js`.
- `develop`: Runs `build:dev` and serves the `/example` directory as a static web page.
